# üè† Airbnb Clone - ALX Project

Welcome to the *Airbnb Clone* project!  
This is a simplified version of the Airbnb platform, built as part of the *ALX Software Engineering Program*.  
The goal of this project is to apply concepts of *Python, OOP, data storage, unit testing, and web development* while working collaboratively on a large-scale project.

## üìñ Project Overview
The Airbnb Clone project will be developed in multiple stages:

1. *Console* - A command interpreter to manage Airbnb objects.  
2. *Storage* - Persisting objects to JSON files (and later a database).  
3. *Web Static* - Creating the front-end with HTML/CSS.  
4. *Web Framework* - Connecting front-end to back-end using Flask.  
5. *RESTful API* - Exposing the application via an API.  
6. *Web Dynamic* - Making the app fully functional with dynamic content.

## üöÄ Features
- Command-line interpreter to manage objects  
- Create, retrieve, update, and delete (CRUD) operations  
- Data persistence with JSON storage  
- Well-structured OOP design  
- Modular codebase for collaboration

## üõ† Technologies Used
- *Python 3.8+*  
- *JSON* (data storage)  
- *UnitTest* (testing framework)  
- *Flask* (web framework, later stage)  
- *HTML/CSS* (front-end design)
